Welcome to our lab website! We are located at the College of Ecology, Lanzhou University. We are a dynamic group exploring ecosystem processes in a changing world. We are particularly interested in understanding how water and carbon cycles are interconnected. We work on a variety of ecosystems, including soils, streams, and wetlands. We emphasize the integration of empirical data with quantitative tools. We also have a keen interest in evaluating and developing statistical tools for ecology. 

We are looking to recruit graduate students and postdocs with background in ecosystem ecology, biogeochemistry or statistics. Please <a href="mailto: chaosong@lzu.edu.cn">contact us</a> if you are interested in joininig the group.
